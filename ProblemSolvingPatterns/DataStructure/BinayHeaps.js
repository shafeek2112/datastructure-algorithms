/***************** Binary Heaps *************************
*   Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules! 
*   In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
*   In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
*    - Each parent has at most two child nodes
*    - The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
*    - In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
*    - A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
*    
*
