/**
*   Stack:
*        -	A LIFO data structure!
*        -	The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack
*
*        -	There is more than one implantation for stacks, like an array, linked list, doubly linked list etc.
*        -	Stacks only need push & pop, so we donâ€™t use Array because it has lot other helper methods.
*        -	We implement out own stack using Linked List. 
*        -	In Singly Linked List, pop is not the constant time as need to loop thorough the entire list to remove the last item. 
*        -	So we use the shift and unshift methods as push & pop here.
*        -	In the Doubly Linked List push and pop are constant time. But here we implement SLL for easier.
